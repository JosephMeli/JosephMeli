## Platform Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer 

Building self-service platforms that make deployment easy and fun. I treat internal developers as customers and obsess over reducing friction between code and production.

## What I Do

I build internal developer platforms, tooling and infrastrucutrethat lets product teams ship faster without wrestling with YAML or waiting on tickets. My focus is on creating streamlined automations that hide complexity while giving developers the control they need. 

## Technical Focus

**Platform & Orchestration:** Kubernetes (multi-cluster), Helm, EKS, Docker, GitOps workflows

**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Ansible, custom Helm charts

**Languages:** Go, Python, Bash

**Observability:** Prometheus, Thanos, Grafana, ELK, Honeycomb

**Cloud:** AWS, Azure

## What I've Built

**Internal Developer Platform** — Self-service pipeline creation, secrets management, and application inventory. Reduced platform team toil by ~20 hours/week and gave developers direct control over their deployments.

**Custom Autoscaling** — HPA implementation using application-specific metrics (not just CPU/memory), letting services scale based on what actually matters to them.

**Go-based Observability Tooling** — Built custom go tooling still used in production to monitor past incidents. 

**Observability Stack Migration** — Moved from SaaS provider to self-hosted Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana/ELK, improving retention and giving teams better visibility into their applications.
